        - Searching replies with certain OPs - good for searching generals.
        - Full-text-search (FTS) using lnx-search. Meilisearch, and others engines are partially supported.
        - Gallery mode for search results.
        - Written using Python3.13 and Quart.

AQ supports MySQL and SQLite, so it's compatible with <a href="https://github.com/bibanon/neofuuka-scraper" target="_blank">Neofuuka (MySQL)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bbepis/Hayden" target="_blank">Hayden (MySQL)</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sky-cake/Ritual" target="_blank">Ritual (SQLite)</a> archive downloaders.
